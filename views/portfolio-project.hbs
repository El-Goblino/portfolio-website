        <h2>Target</h2>
        <p>The target of this project was aimed at my future prospects post graduation.
            Being able to use this site as a tool to showcase my skills and previous works to potenial employers.
            Towards the coding aspect this was also an oppurtunity to expand my knowledge of CSS and industry conventions

    <section class="issues">
        <h2>Issues</h2>
        <p>Issues I found in this project include my overuse of classes and commenting,
            animating with CSS and JavaScript and making my styling engaging and satisfactory.
        </p>

    <section class="resolutions">
        <h2>Resolutions</h2>
        <p>My resolutions for this problems was to rely more of containers and element tags rather than creating seperate classes too often and focusing on commenting from more of a 'Why has this been used?' as opose to 'this is what it is'.
        Animating was a lengthly process having to consult several forums and documentation pages however I have begun to grasp transitions and keyframing with this project.
        The page styling had to be refactored several times (as evident in the commit logs) although my grasp of UI (user interface) and themes has improved.
